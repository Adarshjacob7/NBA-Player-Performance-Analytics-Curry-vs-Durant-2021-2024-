🏀 NBA Player Performance Analysis: Curry vs Durant (2021–2024)

📌Project Overview

This project presents a comparative analysis of offensive and defensive performance of Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant across four NBA seasons (2021–2024). Using SQL for data preparation and Tableau for interactive dashboards, the analysis focuses on efficiency, scoring style, playmaking balance, and defensive contribution, rather than raw box-score totals.

The goal is to demonstrate how data-driven metrics and visual storytelling can be used to compare two elite players with different offensive roles and defensive profiles.

📊 Key Analytical Questions

1. How has each player’s scoring efficiency (TS%) evolved over time?
2. Is scoring driven by efficiency or shot volume?
3. How do their shot profiles and accuracy differ across seasons?
4. How do playmaking responsibility and ball security compare?
5. Who provides greater two-way impact when offense and defense are evaluated together?

🧠 Metrics & Methodology

A. Offensive Analysis
1. True Shooting Percentage (TS%)
2. Points per Game (PPG), Field Goal Attempts (FGA)
3. Assist-to-Turnover efficiency
4. Game Score (overall offensive impact)

B. Defensive Analysis (Proxy-Based)

Due to limited advanced tracking data, defensive impact was measured using custom-built indices:
1. Defensive Activity Index (steals, blocks, rebounds, fouls)
2. Disruption Rate (STL + BLK)
3. Rebounding impact proxies
4. Defensive Discipline score (fouls + turnover percentage)
5. Plus/Minus as contextual on-court impact

📈 Dashboard Highlights

1. TS% efficiency trend lines (main insight)
2. Scoring volume vs efficiency scatter plots
3. Shot mix and shooting accuracy breakdowns
4. Playmaking vs ball security dual-axis charts
5. Two-way impact visualization combining offense and defense

🛠 Tools & Technologies

1. SQL – data cleaning, aggregation, and feature engineering
2. Tableau – interactive dashboards and visual storytelling
3. NBA game log data (2021–2024 seasons)

🎯 Key Takeaways

This project highlights the importance of efficiency-focused metrics and proxy modeling when comparing players with different roles. It demonstrates strong skills in analytical reasoning, metric design, SQL querying, and dashboard development, with an emphasis on clarity and decision-oriented insights.
